# Tools Package Reorganization

This directory contains a reorganized structure for tools in the Assistance app.

## New Structure

### ToolResultDataClasses.kt
- Contains all implementations of `ToolResultData` interface
- Centralizes result data classes for easier maintenance and integration with AI models
- Makes it easier for AI to understand and work with tool result data

### ToolRegistration.kt
- Contains centralized tool registration logic
- Extracted from AIToolHandler.kt for better separation of concerns
- Makes it easier to add new tools or modify existing ones

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status
- The files provide a framework/skeleton for the reorganization
- You'll need to fix some linter errors during implementation:
  - Some method names may need to be corrected based on your actual implementation
  - The ToolCategory values need to be updated to match those defined in your app
  - The runSuspendFunction helper needs to be properly implemented with coroutines

### Migration Process
1. Keep the original files intact for reference
2. Move all ToolResultData implementations from various files to ToolResultDataClasses.kt
3. Move all tool registrations from AIToolHandler.kt to ToolRegistration.kt
4. Update AIToolHandler.kt to use the new ToolRegistration.kt

### Benefits
- Better code organization
- Easier to maintain
- More accessible for AI assistance tools

### Next Steps
1. Fix linter errors in the new files
2. Implement proper coroutine handling
3. Test the new structure with your existing tools
4. Update AIToolHandler.kt to use the new registration pattern
